           This project investigates blood donation campaigns for hospital blood bank system through supply chain discrete time event simulation model. The simulation model was created with parameters from three-month blood donation, blood importation, and blood demand data from a public hospital in Bangkok. Our observation from simulation result shows that there were blood shortages in a hospital blood bank unit. Therefore, we investigated blood stocks with supply increment when blood donation campaigns were applied. This project studied three campaign frequency: everyday, once a month, twice a month. The goal is to find and compare blood increment for each campaign to prevent blood stock shortages. The result showed the lowest blood increment per one-day campaign event and did not have blood shortages is to apply everyday campaign. However, the least total blood increment for the three-month period is once a month campaign. From these 2 results can assume the best campaign is twice a month because blood increment per one-day campaign event and did not have blood shortages is not too high and the total blood increment for the three-month period is similar to once a month campaign.
